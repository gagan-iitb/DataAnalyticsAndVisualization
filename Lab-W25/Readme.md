We will be posting Lab exercises, starter code over here

**Some examples of data collection and visualization**
1.	Prepare a map of your college or university or residential campus on a grid of 1920x1080. Locate the important structures: buildings, water bodies, landmarks. Overlay interesting information on your map: air quality, number of people present at a given time, elevation of the place above sea level etc.
2.	Write down some qualities and attributes of people you know that describe them. Make a word cloud. Now, take the embeddings of those attributes and plot them. Give different colors to each person. Can you identify people with same nature (clusters)?
3.	Write down different activities that you did during a period of time. You can choose a day, or a week, a month, a year or your whole life! Write an estimate of the time you spent on that activity. Draw it as a tree-map. What insights do you gain from this?
4.	Write down all your contacts in your phone or whatsapp or email contact list. If you believe two of your contacts also know each other, then draw an edge between them. Plot this data as a graph. Can you identify clusters? What can you do to complete the graph (find missing edges)?
5.	Compile your expenses from your bank statements of last 5 years. Plot the data and identify any trends, seasonal components, special events etc.

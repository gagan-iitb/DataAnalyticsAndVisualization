 Notes on Plotting Histograms and Heatmaps 
 

 

1. **HISTOGRAMS**:-


A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It divides the entire range of values into intervals (called bins) and counts the number of data points that fall into each bin.

 
*{Mathematical Definition*:-} 

Let  be the data points. Divide the range of data into  bins, where:

The bin width  is:

w = (x) - (x)}{k}

b_i  x < b_{i+1} 

Here,  and  are the edges of the -th bin.

*Steps to Plot a Histogram:-*

1. Choose the number of bins: Use the rule of thumb or algorithms like the Sturges' formula:

k =  _2(n) + 1 

2. Plot the frequencies using bar heights.


Python Code Example:-

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np

% Sample data

data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

% Plotting the histogram

plt.hist(data, bins=30, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)

plt.title('Histogram')

plt.xlabel('Value')

plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.show()


*ACTIVITY ON HISTOGRAM:- *

### Part A: Word Length Histogram
*{Objective}
Create a histogram that represents the frequency of words based on their length in any paragraph from your preferred book.

*{Steps}

     Choose a paragraph from your favorite book.
     Count the number of letters in each word.
     Group words by their lengths (e.g., words with 1 letter, 2 letters, etc.).
     Plot the histogram with:
    
         **X-axis**: Word lengths.
         **Y-axis**: Frequency of words of each length.
    
 ### Part B: Starting Letter Histogram
*{Objective}
Create a histogram to analyze the frequency of words starting with each letter of the alphabet.

*{Steps}

     Use the same paragraph as in Part A.
     Count how many words start with each letter (A-Z).
     Plot the histogram with:
    
         **X-axis**: Starting letters (A-Z).
         **Y-axis**: Frequency of words starting with each letter.

where  t  represents time (from the beginning to today).

*{Steps}

     Create data points for different values of  t  (e.g.,  t = 0, 1, 2,  
     Calculate  w(t)  and  h(t)  for each  t 
     Plot the histogram using:
    
         **X-axis**: Time ( t 
         **Y-axis**: Weight ( w(t)  or Height ( h(t)

Change color, labels, and title.

Add gridlines and annotate the highest frequency bin.

E. Import a real-world dataset (e.g., Iris dataset).

Plot histograms for numerical columns like petal length or sepal width.
     
2. **HEAT MAPS**

A heatmap is a data visualization technique used to represent data in a
matrix format with varying intensities of color to show magnitude.

Mathematical Definition:-

For a matrix  with elements , a heatmap assigns a color  to each cell based on a colormap :

c_{ij} = C(a_{ij})

*Steps to Create a Heatmap:-*

1. Normalize the data: Rescale values if needed.

2. Choose a colormap: Maps numerical values to colors.

3. Visualize the data as a grid.

**Python Code Example:-**

import seaborn as sns

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

%Sample data

data = np.random.rand(10, 10)

%Plotting the heatmap

sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap='viridis')

plt.title('Heatmap')

Part 1: **Basics of Vector Algebra**
1.1 **Vectors**

A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It can be represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with components along the x, y, and z axes. 

For example, a vector  in two-dimensional space can be written as:

 = A_x  + A_y 

where:
-  A_x  and  A_y  are the components of the vector along the x and y axes, respectively.
-  and  are the unit vectors along the x and y axes.


1.2 **Vector Operations**:-

*Addition of Vectors*: The sum of two vectors is obtained by adding their corresponding components.

 +  = (A_x + B_x)  + (A_y + B_y) 

*Scalar Multiplication*: When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, each component of the vector is multiplied by that scalar.

k   = k  A_x  + k  A_y 

*Dot Product*: The dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity given by:

   = A_x  B_x + A_y  B_y

*Cross Product*: The cross product of two vectors gives a vector perpendicular to both vectors. For two 2D vectors  = A_x  + A_y  and  = B_x  + B_y  the cross product is:

   = (A_x B_y - A_y B_x) 

where  is the unit vector along the z-axis.

### Part 2: **Tug of War Problem**

In this problem, we will model a tug of war scenario where three people are pulling a rope from different directions. The goal is to determine the resulting force on the rope by calculating the Vector that is  sum of all the individual forces.

#### **2.1 Problem Description**

Three people are pulling on a rope from different directions:

- Person 1 applies a force of  _1 = 10  + 5   Newtons.\ 

- Person 2 applies a force of  _2 = -8  + 7   Newtons.\ 

- Person 3 applies a force of  _3 = 3  - 6   Newtons.

We will calculate the net force on the rope by adding these vectors together and analyze the direction and magnitude of the result.

2.2 *Steps to solve:-*

1. Add the vectors  _1, _2,  and  _3  

2. Compute the magnitude of the resulting vector. \ 

3. Analyze the direction of the resultant vector.

**ACTIVITY**:-

### Activity: Understanding Vectors through Tug of War
*{Objective}
The goal of this activity is to understand the concept of vectors, their operations (addition, magnitude, and direction), by modeling a tug of war scenario where three people are pulling a rope from different directions.

*{Problem Description}
Three people are pulling on a rope from different directions:

     Person 1 applies a force of  _1 = 10  + 5   Newtons.
     Person 2 applies a force of  _2 = -8  + 7   Newtons.
     Person 3 applies a force of  _3 = 3  - 6   Newtons.

*{Steps to Solve}

     Add the vectors  _1, _2,  and  _3 
    
        _ &= _1 + _2 + _3 
        &= (10  + 5 ) + (-8  + 7 ) + (3  - 6 ) 
        &= (10 - 8 + 3)  + (5 + 7 - 6)  
        &= 5  + 6 .
    

     Compute the magnitude of the resulting vector  _ 
    
        |_| &=

        &=   7.81  .
    
   Analyze the direction of the resultant vector:
    
         &= ^{-1} ( } ) 
        &= ^{-1} ( {5} ) 
        &= ^{-1} (1.2) 
        & 50.19^    .
    

*{Discussion Points}

     **Addition of Vectors:** Demonstrates how forces combine in two dimensions.
     **Magnitude of the Resultant Vector:** Shows how to calculate the strength of the net force.
     **Direction of the Resultant Vector:** Explains the use of trigonometry to find the orientation of the net force.

Part 3: *Python Implementation*

Let's implement the solution in Python using numpy to handle vector operations efficiently.

Python:-

import numpy as np

# Define the force vectors \ 

F1 = np.array([10, 5])  # Force from person 1 \ 

F2 = np.array([-8, 7])  # Force from person 2 \ 

F3 = np.array([3, -6])  # Force from person 3 \ 

Step 1: Calculate the net force (vector sum)
net_force = F1 + F2 + F3

Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of the net force
magnitude = np.linalg.norm(net_force)

Step 3: Find the direction of the net force (angle with respect to x-axis) \ 

direction = np.arctan2(net_force[1], net_force[0])  Angle in radians \ 

direction_degrees = np.degrees(direction)  # Convert to degrees \  

%Display the results
print("Net Force Vector (F_net):", net_force)

print("Magnitude of Net Force:", magnitude, "Newtons")

print("Direction of Net Force:", direction_degrees, "degrees") 
---
\ 
 \ 

**Output:**

Net Force Vector (F_net): [5 6]

Magnitude of Net Force: 7.810249675906654 Newtons

Direction of Net Force: 50.19442890773457 degrees.

 **CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY:-**

Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In other words, it quantifies the likelihood of an event  A  happening, under the condition that event  B  is known to have occurred. The conditional probability of  A  given  B  is denoted as  P(A | B)  and it is calculated using the formula:

P(A | B) = {P(B)}

*where:*

-  P(A  B)  is the probability that both events  A  and  B  occur (i.e., the intersection of  A  and  B 
-  P(B)  is the probability that event  B  occurs.

### **Dice Experiment and Conditional Probability**

Let's consider a dice experiment. We roll a standard 6-sided die, and letâ€™s define the following events:

- *Event A*: The die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6).

- *Event B*: The die shows a number greater than 3 (4, 5, or 6).

We want to calculate the conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred, i.e.,  P(A | B) 

### *Step-by-Step Calculation*:-

#### Step 1: Define the Sample Space
The sample space  S  for a 6-sided die is:

S =  2, 3, 4, 5, 6

#### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Event B,  P(B) 
Event B occurs when the die shows a number greater than 3. So,  B =  5, 6  The probability of event B is:

P(B) =  B}{ S} = {6} = 0.5

#### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of the Intersection of Events A and B,  P(A  B) 
The intersection of events A and B,  A  B  occurs when the die shows a number that is both even (from event A) and greater than 3 (from event B). The numbers that satisfy both conditions are   6 

So,  A  B =  6  and the probability of this intersection is:

P(A  B) =  A  B}{  S} = {6} = 0.3333

#### Step 4: Apply the Conditional Probability Formula
Now, we can apply the formula for conditional probability:

P(A | B) = {P(B)} = {6}}{{6}} = {3}

So, the conditional probability of event A (the die shows an even number) given that event B (the die shows a number greater than 3) has occurred is:

P(A | B) = {3}


\ 

###* Interpretation* 

Given that the die has shown a number greater than 3, the probability that it is also an even number (either 4 or 6) is  {3}  This conditional probability helps us understand how the knowledge of event B influences the likelihood of event A.

*{Activity: Understanding Conditional Probability Using a Dice Experiment}

*{Objective}
To understand the concept of conditional probability through a simple dice-rolling experiment.

*{Materials Needed}

     A six-sided die (standard die with faces numbered 1 to 6).
     Pen and paper (or a whiteboard) for recording outcomes.

*{Instructions}

*{Step 1: Define the Experiment}

     Roll a standard six-sided die multiple times (e.g., 20 trials).
     Record the outcome of each roll.

*{Step 2: Define Events}
Let:

     **Event A**: The die roll results in an even number ( 4, 6
     **Event B**: The die roll results in a number greater than 3 ( 5, 6

*{Step 3: Conduct the Experiment}

     Roll the die and record the outcomes.
     For each roll, determine whether it satisfies Event A, Event B, or both.

*{Step 4: Analyze the Results}

     Count the number of rolls where:
          
               Event A occurs ( n(A) 
               Event B occurs ( n(B) 
               Both Event A and Event B occur ( n(A  B) 
          
     Use the frequency of these events to estimate probabilities:
          
          P(A) = ,  
          P(B) = ,  
          P(A  B) = .
          

*{Step 5: Calculate Conditional Probabilities}
Using the formula for conditional probability:

P(A  B) = {P(B)}

     Substitute the experimental values of  P(A  B)  and  P(B)  into the formula.
     Interpret the result:
          
                P(A  B)  Probability of rolling an even number, given that the number is greater than 3.
          

*{Example of Recorded Data (Sample Table)}

{cccccc}

**Trial** & **Outcome** & **Event A (Even)** & **Event B ( & **Both A and B**  

1 & 4 & Yes & Yes & Yes  
2 & 2 & Yes & No & No  
3 & 5 & No & Yes & No  
4 & 6 & Yes & Yes & Yes  
5 & 3 & No & No & No  

... & ... & ... & ... & ...  

*{Discussion Points}

     **Theoretical Probability**:
          
                P(A) = {6} = 0.5  (since there are 3 even numbers out of 6).
                P(B) = {6} = 0.5  (since there are 3 numbers greater than 3).
                P(A  B) = {6} = 0.333  (only 4 and 6 satisfy both conditions).
          
          Using these values:
          
          P(A  B) = {P(B)} = {0.5}  0.666
          
     **Connection to Real-World Applications**:
          Conditional probability is used in fields like medicine (e.g., probability of disease given a positive test result) and weather forecasting.

*{Extension Activity}

     Modify the conditions of the experiment. For example:
          
               Event A: Rolling a multiple of 3 ( 6
               Event B: Rolling an odd number ( 3, 5
          
     Explore the relationship between the events when they are independent or mutually exclusive.

***Python Code Implementation:-***

We can simulate this dice experiment and compute the conditional probability using Python:

import numpy as np

# Define the sample space for a 6-sided die

sample_space = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Define the events A and B

A = [2, 4, 6]  # Even numbers

B = [4, 5, 6]  # Numbers greater than 3

# Calculate P(A âˆ© B) - intersection of A and B

intersection_A_B = list(set(A) & set(B))

# Calculate P(B)

P_B = len(B) / len(sample_space)

# Calculate P(A âˆ© B)

P_A_intersection_B = len(intersection_A_B) / len(sample_space)

# Calculate P(A | B) using the formula

P_A_given_B = P_A_intersection_B / P_B

# Display the result

print("P(A | B) =", P_A_given_B)

### Output:

P(A | B) = 0.6666666666666666

This Python code confirms our theoretical calculation that the conditional probability of event A given event B is  {3}
